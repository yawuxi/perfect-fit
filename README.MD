# Perfect Fit - GNOME Extension

Perfect Fit is a lightweight GNOME Shell extension that improves your workflow by automatically centering windows and resizing them to a customizable portion of the screen. Itâ€™s designed for users who appreciate a clean, consistent desktop layout without having to manually adjust window positions every time.

## Features
- ðŸªŸ Auto-Center & Resize: Instantly centers the focused window and resizes it to a user-defined percentage of the screen.

- âš¡ Fast & Lightweight: Minimal resource usage, no unnecessary overhead.

- ðŸ”§ Customizable: Change the hotkey and resize ratio via the extension settings.

- ðŸ§˜ Hassle-Free Workflow: Keeps your workspace tidy with one simple shortcut.

## Usage
By default, you can trigger Perfect Fit using a keyboard shortcut <kbd>SUPER</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>. When activated, the currently focused window will be resized and centered on the screen.

## Customization
Open the extension settings to:
- Change the activation hotkey
- Adjust the resize ratio (from 0.5 to 1.0) to control how much of the screen the window should occupy

## Notes
The hotkey customization component in `prefs.ts` was adapted from [Tiling Shell](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell). Credit to the original authors for their clean and reusable implementation.

## Todo
- [ ] The extension cannot correctly position GNOME Terminal in the center of the screen.
